          Expressive Voting is a short book about election reform.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book discusses 4 different reforms that I believe would increase voter turnout.  This would generate a more effective government while also impacting the voters themselves in a positive way.
        </p>
        <p>
          First I make some observations about how elections might play out if voters were able to <b>vote for more than one candidate</b>.  Then I discuss how to use technology to <b>detect election fraud</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next I share a strategy for <b>circumventing the Electoral College</b> that would only require the cooperation of a single state's legislature.  Finally, I share some comments on how to more effectively <b>enfranchise our electorate</b>, and briefly discuss some of the <b>benefits associated with high turnout</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last chapter, I propose a social-network-style election platform that I believe would streamline the process of electing amazing candidates.  I have begun work on this web site, which will soon be available right here.  It will allow voters the ability to do these actions and a few more:
          <ul>
            <li>rank candidates on a scale of 0-500</li>
            <li>update the ratings as many times as they like</li>
            <li>create lists of candidates and share them publicly</li>
            <li>direct questions to candidates, and share their own thoughts on issues</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
